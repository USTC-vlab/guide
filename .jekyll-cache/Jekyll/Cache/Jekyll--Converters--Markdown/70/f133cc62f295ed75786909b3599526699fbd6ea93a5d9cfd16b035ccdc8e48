<p>If you‚Äôre using the doc as code approach, you might also consider using the same techniques for reviewing the doc as people use in reviewing code. This approach will involve using Github to edit the files.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an Edit me button on each page on this theme. This button allows collaborators to edit the content on Github.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the code for that button on the page.html layout for GitHub:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% if site.github_editme_path %}

&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/{{site.github_editme_path}}/{{page.folder}}{{page.url | append: ".md"}}{% endif %}" class="btn btn-default githubEditButton" role="button"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Edit me&lt;/a&gt;

{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and here for GitLab:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{% if site.gitlab_editme_path %}

&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/{{site.gitlab_editme_path}}/{{page.folder}}{{page.url | append: ".md"}}{% endif %}" class="btn btn-default githubEditButton" role="button"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-gitlab fa-lg"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Edit me&lt;/a&gt;

{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In your configuration file, edit the value for <code class="highlighter-rouge">github_editme_path</code> (or for Gitlab: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitlab_editme_path</code>). For example, you might create a branch called ‚Äúreviews‚Äù on your Github repo. Then you would add something like this in your configuration file for the ‚Äògithub_editme_path‚Äô: tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll/edit/reviews. Here ‚Äútomjoht‚Äù is my github account name. The repo name is ‚Äúdocumentation-theme-jekyll‚Äù. The ‚Äúreviews‚Äù name is the branch.</p>

<p>To suppress this button, comment out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">github_editme_path</code> in the _config.yml file.</p>

<h2 id="add-reviewers-as-collaborators">Add reviewers as collaborators</h2>

<p>If you want people to collaborate on your project so that their edits get committed to a branch on your project, you need to add them as collaborators. For your Github repo, click <strong>Settings</strong> and add the collaborators on the Collaborators tab using their Github usernames.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt want to allow anyone to commit to your Github branch, don‚Äôt add the reviewers as collaborators. When someone makes an edit, Github will fork the theme. The person‚Äôs edit then will appear as a pull request to your repo. You can then choose to merge the change indicated in the pull or not.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> When you process pull requests, you have to accept everything or nothing. You can‚Äôt pick and choose which changes you‚Äôll merge. Therefore you‚Äôll probably want to edit the branch you‚Äôre planning to merge or ask the contributor to make some changes to the fork before processing the pull request.</div>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>Users will make edits in your ‚Äúreviews‚Äù branch (or whatever you want to call it). You can then commit those edits as you make updates.</p>

<p>When you‚Äôre finished making all updates in the branch, you can merge the branch into the master.</p>

<p>Note that if you‚Äôre making updates online, those updates will be out of sync with any local edits.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <b>Warning:</b> Don‚Äôt make edits both online using Github‚Äôs browser-based interface AND offline on your local machine using your local tools. When you try to push from your local, you‚Äôll likely get a merge conflict error. Instead, make sure you do a pull and update on your local after making any edits online.</div>

<h2 id="proseio">Prose.io</h2>

<p>Prose.io is an overlay on Github that would allow people to make comments in an easier interface. If you simply go to <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>, it asks to authorize your Github account, and so it will read files directly from Github but in the Prose.io interface.</p>
